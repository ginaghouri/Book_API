Interact with "Library" API:
To simulate the interaction run the main.py script you should see a list of available books and can add and delete books from the library db. Books are stored in the MySQL database the user configures. The API handles the interactions between the client-side and the database, ensuring that books can be viewed, added, updated and deleted.
